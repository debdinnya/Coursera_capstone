Before you are shifting to a new place, it will be a natural curiosity for everyone to get to know the neighbourhood well. Whether you have a good connectivity to major areas within the city, whether you have a good school where you can educate your children, how much is the housing cost in the area, etc. The model will help to clarify all these doubts and will provide you the latest update as and when new locations are added to the neighbourhood. The model will use Foursquare API to fetch the location data and will surely be a one stop solution to all your needs. "
