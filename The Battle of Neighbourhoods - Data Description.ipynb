Once the input data is downloaded, the model will cleanse the data like if the Borough or neighbourhood has any unassigned names, or if a postal code is assigned to more than one borough or neighbourhood. After this sanity check, the model will use python \"geocoder\" module to fetch the latitude and longitude details of all these locations. Once that data is available, we will now use the latitude and longitude details and set a predefined radius and then use these details to explore all hotspot areas within the neighbourhood using Foursquare API.\n",
