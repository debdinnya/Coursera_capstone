    "The purpose of this Project is to help people to explore available facilities around their neighborhood. It will help people to find out the best neighbourhood among a given number neighborhoods to reside in Scarborough, Toronto. Lots of people are migrating to various states of Canada and needed lots of research for good housing prices and reputated schools for their children. This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods, which provides ease of access to Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital, like minded people, etc.\n",

    "This Project aims to create an analysis of features for people migrating to Scarborough to search a best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both freash and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n",

Once the input data is downloaded, the model will cleanse the data like if the Borough or neighbourhood has any unassigned names, or if a postal code is assigned to more than one borough or neighbourhood. After this sanity check, the model will use python \"geocoder\" module to fetch the latitude and longitude details of all these locations. Once that data is available, we will now use the latitude and longitude details and set a predefined radius and then use these details to explore all hotspot areas within the neighbourhood using Foursquare API.\n",

As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n",

For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 100 meter.
